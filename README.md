# Spiritlabs Toolbox For Mac

This is a script for fast reinstall software after reinstall MacOS.
I also added some other features. E.g. a Monokai theme for Xcode or a space adder for the  MacOS Dock.

The script is easy to extend. You can add more software packages only by writing the name of it in the Formulae arrays at the top of the script.

```shell
# Cask Formulae
declare -a OfficeFormulae=("typora")
declare -a CloudFormulae=("nextcloud")
declare -a MessengerFormulae=("whatsapp" "discord")
```


The spacers for the Dock are looking like that
